##Rename retro prepandemic variable names in EDEQ

##**need to rename these the same as baseline / waves
```{r}
dat.edeq <- dat.edeq %>% 
  rename(
    edeq.sick_means_made_shape_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.sick_means_made_shape.1_baseline,
    edeq.felt_anxious_blue_bored.3_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.felt_anxious_blue_bored.3_baseline,
    edeq.sick_means_made_shape.1_.Waveretro_prepan =  edeq.sick_means_made_shape.1_baseline,
    edeq.diuretics_laxatives_means_shape.1_.Waveretro_prepan= edeq.diuretics_laxatives_means_shape.1_baseline,
    edeq.compulsive_driven_burn_calories.1_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.compulsive_driven_burn_calories.1_baseline ,
    edeq.nibbled_picked_snacks_grazed.1_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.nibbled_picked_snacks_grazed.1_baseline,
    edeq.felt_anxious_blue_bored.2_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.felt_anxious_blue_bored.2_baseline,
    edeq.regard_lost_control_eaten.1_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.regard_lost_control_eaten.1_baseline,
    edeq.calories_made_body_shape.1_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.calories_made_body_shape.1_baseline,
    edeq.weight_influenced_person.1_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.weight_influenced_person.1_baseline,
    edeq.dissatisfied_shape_weight.1_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.dissatisfied_shape_weight.1_baseline,
    edeq.actively_been_monitoring_your_shape_or_weight_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.actively_been_monitoring_your_shape_or_weight_.1_baseline,
    edeq.eating_behaviours_concerns_distressed_.Waveretro_prepan = edeq.eating_behaviours_concerns_distressed.1_baseline

    )

```

##PLOTS - EDEQ
1. Need to select variables to use (don't want numeric ones in there as then can't re-structure the data)
```{r}

dat.edeq.long.prep1 <- dat.edeq %>% 
  select(!contains(".Wavebaseline_numeric"))

dat.edeq.long.prep2 <- dat.edeq.long.prep1 %>% 
  select(!contains("baseline_numeric"))

 colnames(dat.edeq.long.prep2) 
 
```

2. Restructure data into long 
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
dat.edeq.long <- dat.edeq.long.prep2 %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = (starts_with("edeq") &
              contains(".Wave")),
    names_to = "wave_edeq",
    values_to = "value") %>%
  separate(wave_edeq, into = c("edeq", "wave"), sep = "_.Wave", remove = TRUE) %>%
  pivot_wider(
     names_from = "edeq",
     values_from = "value")

colnames(dat.edeq.long)

```
