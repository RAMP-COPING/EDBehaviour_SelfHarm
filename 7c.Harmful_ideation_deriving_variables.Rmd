title: "Deriving variables: Suicidal and/or self-harm ideation"

This script derives variables for the suicidal and/or self-harm ideation phenotype ready for regression analyses.
NB: I first clean 'suicidal ideation' and 'self-harm ideation' separately before combining into a variable called 'harmful ideation' which represents 'suicidal and/or self-harm ideation'. We have merged these two variables because they are highly correlated (>0.8).

Configure global options for all chunks
```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = '',
  prompt = FALSE,
  cache = FALSE
  )
```

Clear global environment prior to initiation
```{r Clear global environment}
remove(list = ls())
```

Read in file with path to data channel
```{r Read in file with path to data channel}
source(file = "../credentials/paths.R")
```

Add the add_numeric function - used to convert character variables into numeric variables
Add the remove_duplicates function - used to deduplicate and remove NAs from IDs
Add the sumscores function - used to generate sumscores
Add the package_check function - used to install and load dependencies
Add the imp_check function - used to check variables for implausible values
```{r Read in functions}
source(file = paste0(filepath_functions, "add_numeric.R"))
source(file = paste0(filepath_functions, "remove_duplicates.R"))
source(file = paste0(filepath_functions, "package_check.R"))
source("./functions.R")
```

Use package_check to install and load dependencies
Load tidyverse last
```{r Install load dependencies}
packages <- c("summarytools", "sjlabelled", "Amelia", "gtsummary", "tidyverse")
package_check(packages)
```

Retrieve recent date
We are using the recent date to save files with paste0() as an extension to not overwrite old versions
```{r Recent date}
date <- Sys.Date()
date
```

# Read in data
```{r Read in dataset}
dat_exposure_info <- readRDS(paste0(filepath_saved_data, "exposures_all_models2022-04-28.rds"))
dat_all_info <- readRDS(paste0(filepath_saved_data, "final_dat_no_dup_entries2022-02-21.rds"))

# Merge
dat <- dplyr::full_join(dat_all_info,
                        dat_exposure_info,
                        by ="ID")
```

# Outcome = Passive suicidal ideation
## Derive ANY passive suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic
### Experience during past two weeks 
In the follow ups, participants are asked: "Many people have thoughts that life is not worth living. Have you felt that way?" If "Yes", they are asked: "Have you felt that way in the past two weeks?"

### Experience ever
In the follow ups and baseline, participants are also asked: "Many people have thoughts that life is not worth living. Have you felt that way". We need to capture both; people might endorse lifetime experience but not have felt that way in the past two weeks (either if they missed out on a follow up questionnaire so the gap between them was longer than two weeks, or because they've answered at a monthly follow-up [i.e., from August 2020 onwards])

### PREPANDEMIC passive suicidal ideation 
At baseline, participants are first asked: "Many people have thoughts that life is not worth living. Have you felt that way?" (taf.worth_living_thoughts_life_.Wavebaseline) Only those who say "Yes" are then asked "Had you felt that way before the pandemic?" (taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline). Therefore, we need to count those say "No" to the first question, AND those who say "Yes" to the first but "No" to the second as having no prepandemic experience.
```{r Passive suicidal ideation baseline pre-pandemic experience}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(PREPANDEMIC_passive_suicidal_ideation =
           case_when(
             
                  taf.worth_living_life_people_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Never experienced it (lifetime)
                  
                    taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Have in their life but not before the pandemic
                    taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline == "Yes" ~ 1 # Have in their life AND before the pandemic
                  )
                      
           )

           freq(taf.worth_living_life_people_.Wavebaseline) # Some NAs are people who said yes to lifetime but then PNTA or NA to pre-pandemic or NA

dat %>%
  filter(is.na(PREPANDEMIC_passive_suicidal_ideation)) %>%
           freq(taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline)
```

### NEW passive suicidal ideation experience, i.e., those who at baseline indicated no prepandemic experience of passive suicidal ideation and then went on to experience it
Combined - passive suicidal ideation during the pandemic 
*Basically, if someone has said that they experienced it BEFORE the pandemic AND they endorse lifetime experience during the pandemic, it's hard for us to work out whether their experience is ONLY BEFORE the pandemic (therefore, should be 0 for pandemic experience) or whether they are referencing their experience BEFORE the pandemic AND during the pandemic (so should be 1 for pandemic experience). Decided to just look at those with NO prepandemic experience.
```{r Derive NEW passive suicidal ideation experience}

### Experience ever
In the follow ups, participants are also asked lifetime self-harm ideation: "Have you contemplated harming yourself?". We need to capture both; people might endorse lifetime experience but not have felt that way in the past two weeks (either if they missed out on a follow up questionnaire so the gap between them was longer than two weeks, or because they've answered at a monthly follow-up [i.e., from August 2020 onwards])

### PREPANDEMIC self-harm ideation 
At baseline, participants are first asked: "Have you contemplated harming yourself ?" (taf.have_you_contemplated_harming_yourself_.Wavebaseline) Only those who say "Yes" are then asked "Had you felt that way before the pandemic?" (taf.pandemic_felt.1_.Wavebaseline). Therefore, we need to count those say "No" to the first question, AND those who say "Yes" to the first but "No" to the second as having no prepandemic experience.

# Identify at which phase they first experienced the outcome
This is for ensuring the exposure is reported either BEFORE or in the SAME PHASE as the outcome. E.g,. we do not want to include cases of binge eating (for example) if they exposure (e.g., living situation change) was self-reported AFTER the binge eating.
First, need to identify at which phase participants first experienced each outcome, to ensure that their experience of the exposure happened BEFORE the outcome.

# EXPOSURES / EXPLANATORY VARIABLES
[NB: for the below exposures, will need to derive these differently depending on the outcome because they were reported at every/every other phase and we are taking only those reported BEFORE or in the SAME PHASE as the outcome]
  • Positive COVID test or ill due to COVID  
  • Loss of loved one due to COVID
  • Change in economic activity
  • Change in living situation
  
*The below use follow-up data and are coded so that exposures are only counted if they happened before or in same phase as the outcome*
