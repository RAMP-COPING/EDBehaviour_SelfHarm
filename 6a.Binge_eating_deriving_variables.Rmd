This script derives variables for the binge eating phenotype ready for regression analyses.
Configure global options for all chunks
```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = '',
  prompt = FALSE,
  cache = FALSE
  )
```

Clear global environment prior to initiation
```{r Clear global environment}
remove(list = ls())
```

Add the add_numeric function - used to convert character variables into numeric variables
Add the remove_duplicates function - used to deduplicate and remove NAs from IDs
Add the sumscores function - used to generate sumscores
Add the package_check function - used to install and load dependencies
Add the imp_check function - used to check variables for implausible values
```{r Read in functions}
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/add_numeric.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/remove_duplicates.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/package_check.R")
source("./functions.R")
```

Use package_check to install and load dependencies
Load tidyverse last
```{r Install load dependencies}
packages <- c("summarytools", "sjlabelled", "Amelia", "gtsummary", "tidyverse")
package_check(packages)
```

Retrieve recent date
We are using the recent date to save files with paste0() as an extension to not overwrite old versions
```{r Recent date}
date <- Sys.Date()
date
```

# Read in data
```{r Read in dataset}
dat <- readRDS("/Users/helenadavies/werk/EDBEHSELFHARM2/gitEDBEHSELFHARM/data_cleaned/final_dat_no_dup_entries2022-02-21.rds")

# Identify at which phase they first experienced the outcome
This is for ensuring the exposure is reported either BEFORE or in the SAME PHASE as the outcome. E.g,. we do not want to include cases of binge eating (for example) if they exposure (e.g., living situation change) was self-reported AFTER the binge eating.
First, need to identify at which phase participants first experienced each outcome, to ensure that their experience of the exposure happened BEFORE the outcome.

[NB: only need to get the below within one script as will not change depending on outcome]
  •	Age
  •	Gender

## Increased loneliness at baseline
First, create numeric variable that demonstrates baseline PANDEMIC loneliness score
All questions begin with: Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt that the following statements apply to you?
```{r Baseline pandemic loneliness score}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("lone."),
                ~case_when(
                  . == "Hardly ever" ~ 0,
                  . == "Some of the time" ~ 1,
                  .  == "Often" ~ 2,
                  TRUE ~ NA_real_)))

```

Calculate PANDEMIC loneliness score
```{r Loneliness baseline score}
dat$loneliness_pandemic_count <- rowSums(dat[ ,
                                 c("lone.felt_alone",
                                   "lone.felt_isolated_from_others",
                                   "lone.felt_left_out",
                                   "lone.felt_that_you_lack_companionship")],
                                  na.rm = FALSE)

# Check
dat %>%
  freq(loneliness_pandemic_count)
```

Create numeric variable that demonstrates PREPANDEMIC loneliness score
Score of loneliness pre-pandemic
 All questions start with: Before the pandemic, how often have you felt that the following statements apply to you?
```{r Loneliness prepandemic score}
dat$loneliness_prepandemic_count <- rowSums(dat[ ,
                                 c("lone.felt_alone.1",
                                   "lone.felt_isolated_from_others.1",
                                   "lone.felt_left_out.1",
                                   "lone.felt_that_you_lack_companionship.1")],
                                  na.rm = FALSE)

# Check
dat %>%
  freq(loneliness_prepandemic_count)
```

Calculate whether they have experienced an increase in loneliness during the pandemic or not 
```{r Loneliness increased during pandemic}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(increased_loneliness_during_pandemic =
           case_when(
           loneliness_pandemic_count > loneliness_prepandemic_count ~ "Yes", # These people have higher loneliness scores at baseline than retrospective prepandemic loneliness scores
         loneliness_pandemic_count <= loneliness_prepandemic_count ~ "No" # These people have lower or the same loneliness scores at baseline than retrospective prepandemic loneliness scores
         )
  )

# Check
dat %>%
  freq(increased_loneliness_during_pandemic)
```

## Pandemic worry at baseline 
Participants are asked how worried they are about different factors, e.g., mental health, or employment. Before working out total score - First need to work out if participants answered any of these as 'not applicable' or if they did not answer (i.e., missing).

First need to create new variables in which '5' i.e., 'Not applicable' = 0, so that it is not included in final calculation of score. We can think of something not being applicable to someone in the same way as it not worrying them.
```{r Pandemic worry recode 'Not applicable' to 0}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("panworry.") &
                  contains("numeric"),
                ~case_when(
                  . == 5 ~ 0,
                  TRUE ~ .)))
```

Sum score of answers (e.g., score of 4 on a question = "Extremely worried")
```{r Pandemic worry sum score actual answers}
dat$panworry_total_score <- rowSums(dat[ ,
                                 c("panworry.impact_on_your_employment_status_numeric",

*The below use follow-up data and are coded so that exposures are only counted if they happened before or in same phase as the outcome*

## Positive covid test - three questionnaires (virus, resp, & dem)
NB: For the 'virus' questionnaire, there is no baseline assessment. However, there is a 'resp' questionnaire that is asked at baseline and at every follow up phase, so will include positive tests indicated in this questionnaire too, as well as people who indicated they were unwell with coronavirus in any of the demographic questionnaires.

Need to ensure COVID test occurred BEFORE outcomes - create new variable for COVID test that only counts positive tests as ones that occurred BEFORE each outcome. Will exclude anyone from the analysis if they experienced outcome before exposure, EVEN if it went: outcome → exposure → outcome. Should look at whether their FIRST experience of outcome came before (or at the same time of) their FIRST experience of exposure

Will also include co-occurring symptoms, but as a sensitivity analysis will get rid to further assess causal hypothesis.

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
```{r First experience of exposure - positive COVID test - virus, dem and resp Q}

## Losing someone due to COVID-19 (grief)
There are two questions in COPING that capture whether someone has lost someone due to COVID, in the 'grief' questionnaire in follow up B only and baseline ("In the past month, have you lost someone close to you due to COVID-19?") and the demographics questionnaire ("Has a relative that was previously ill with coronavirus or suspected coronavirus passed away?") in follow up A and B [not at baseline]

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
```{r First experience of exposure - losing someone}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(exposure_phase_losing_someone =
           case_when( 
                       ( # In the past month, have you lost someone close to you due to COVID-19?

## Change in main eco activity (work/education)
### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure

Baseline:
employ.my_employment_status_has_not_changed = Has your employment status changed since the pandemic began? [My employment status has not changed]
employ.no_impact = How has this impacted your studies? [No impact]
employ.impact_on_studies_still_unknown = How has this impacted your studies? [Impact on studies still unknown]

Follow ups:
dem.household_employment_status_key: Has anything changed in the following domains in the last two weeks: Employment status of a key earner in your household
dem.employment: Has anything changed in the following domains in the last two weeks: Employment 
NB: No follow-up questions about studying.

Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.

## Change in living situation
### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure

Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
