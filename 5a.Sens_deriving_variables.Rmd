title: "Deriving variables: Sensitivity analysis"
author: "Helena Davies"
date: "21/12/2021"

---

This script derives variables ready for sensitivity analysis in which exposures must come BEFORE outcomes and NOT in the same phase. Therefore, all baseline reports of outcomes do not count (apart from exposures reported in GLAD or EDGI original sign-up survey) and we have amended the 'exposures before outcome' chunks.

```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = '',
  prompt = FALSE,
  cache = FALSE
  )
```

Clear global environment prior to initiation
```{r Clear global environment}
remove(list = ls())
```

Add the add_numeric function - used to convert character variables into numeric variables
Add the remove_duplicates function - used to deduplicate and remove NAs from IDs
Add the sumscores function - used to generate sumscores
Add the package_check function - used to install and load dependencies
Add the imp_check function - used to check variables for implausible values
```{r Read in functions}
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/add_numeric.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/remove_duplicates.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/package_check.R")
source("./functions.R")
```

Use package_check to install and load dependencies
Load tidyverse last
```{r Install load dependencies}
packages <- c("summarytools", "sjlabelled", "Amelia", "gtsummary", "tidyverse")
package_check(packages)
```

Retrieve recent date
We are using the recent date to save files with paste0() as an extension to not overwrite old versions
```{r Recent date}
date <- Sys.Date()
date
```

# Read in data
## data.final is generated from the "4.Merging" script
```{r Read in data}
dat <- readRDS(file = "../data_cleaned/all_dat2021-12-21.rds")

# Check

OUTCOMES

•	NEW Eating disorder behaviour:
    o	binge eating during the COVID-19 pandemic: binary (1,0)
    o	low weight during the COVID-19 pandemic: binary (1,0)

•	NEW Self-harm thoughts/behaviour:
    o	passive suicidal ideation during COVID-19 pandemic: binary (1,0)
    o	self-harm ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic: binary (1,0)
    o	self-harm during the COVID-19 pandemic: binary (1,0)

•	Frequency of all the above behaviors:

o	Cumulative score; 
    	scores of 3 indicate someone has experienced all of the above during the pandemic
    	scores of 2 indicate someone has experienced two of the above during the pandemic
    	scores of 1 indicate someone has experienced one of the above during the pandemic
    	scores of 0 indicate someone has experienced none of the above during the pandemic

### Experience ever
In the follow ups and baseline, participants are also asked: "Many people have thoughts that life is not worth living. Have you felt that way". We need to capture both; people might endorse lifetime experience but not have felt that way in the past two weeks (either if they missed out on a follow up questionnaire so the gap between them was longer than two weeks, or because they've answered at a monthly follow-up [i.e., from August 2020 onwards])

### PREPANDEMIC passive suicidal ideation 
At baseline, participants are first asked: "Many people have thoughts that life is not worth living. Have you felt that way?" (taf.worth_living_thoughts_life_.Wavebaseline) Only those who say "Yes" are then asked "Had you felt that way before the pandemic?" (taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline). Therefore, we need to count those say "No" to the first question, AND those who say "Yes" to the first but "No" to the second as having no prepandemic experience.
```{r Passive suicidal ideation baseline pre-pandemic experience}

### NEW passive suicidal ideation experience, i.e., those who at baseline indicated no prepandemic experience of binge eating
Combined - passive suicidal ideation during the pandemic 
*Basically, if someone has said that they experienced it BEFORE the pandemic AND they endorse lifetime experience during the pandemic, it's hard for us to work out whether their experience is ONLY BEFORE the pandemic (therefore, should be 0 for pandemic experience) or whether they are referencing their experience BEFORE the pandemic AND during the pandemic (so should be 1 for pandemic experience). Decided to just look at those with NO prepandemic experience.

### Experience ever
In the follow ups, participants are also asked lifetime self-harm ideation: "Have you contemplated harming yourself?". We need to capture both; people might endorse lifetime experience but not have felt that way in the past two weeks (either if they missed out on a follow up questionnaire so the gap between them was longer than two weeks, or because they've answered at a monthly follow-up [i.e., from August 2020 onwards])

### PREPANDEMIC self-harm ideation 
At baseline, participants are first asked: "Have you contemplated harming yourself ?" (taf.have_you_contemplated_harming_yourself_.Wavebaseline) Only those who say "Yes" are then asked "Had you felt that way before the pandemic?" (taf.pandemic_felt.1_.Wavebaseline). Therefore, we need to count those say "No" to the first question, AND those who say "Yes" to the first but "No" to the second as having no prepandemic experience.

```{r Self-harm ideation prepandemic experience}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(PREPANDEMIC_selfharm_ideation =
           case_when(
                     taf.have_you_contemplated_harming_yourself_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Never experienced it in their life
                     
                     taf.pandemic_felt.1_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Have experienced it in their life but not before the pandemic

### NEW self-harm ideation experience, i.e., those who at baseline indicated no prepandemic experience of binge eating
Combined - self-harm ideation during the pandemic
*Basically, if someone has said that they experienced it BEFORE the pandemic AND they endorse lifetime experience during the pandemic, it's hard for us to work out whether their experience is ONLY BEFORE the pandemic (therefore, should be 0 for pandemic experience) or whether they are referencing their experience BEFORE the pandemic AND during the pandemic (so should be 1 for pandemic experience). Decided to just use data from those with no prepan experience.

### PREPANDEMIC self-harm 
At baseline, participants are asked: "Before the pandemic, had you deliberately harmed yourself, whether or not you meant to end your life?" (taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline). Note again, there is no lifetime assessment of self-harm.
```{r Prepandemic self-harm experience}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(PREPANDEMIC_selfharm =
           case_when(
                    taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Not experienced self-harm before the pandemic
                    taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline == "Yes" ~ 1 # Experienced self-harm before the pandemic

### Self-harm during the pandemic 
Combined - self-harm ideation: BASELINE experience OR FOLLOW UP experience (participants may have indicated experiencing it at baseline and/or at follow-up)

NB: This question "Before the pandemic, had you deliberately harmed yourself, whether or not you meant to end your life?" is shown to everyone, so I don't need to use the same logic as with the other baseline questions (i.e., there is no screener question that asks about lifetime self-harm). Because there is no lifetime assessment of self-harm, there might be some people who joined the study later (e.g., in November 2020) and had self-harmed earlier in the pandemic (e.g., July) but we would not capture them.
```{r Combined self-harm baseline and follow up experience}

# EXPOSURES / EXPLANATORY VARIABLES
NB: For exposures assessed at baseline, I should include one model which includes 'baseline' new experiences of outcome, and another without (i.e., one with co-occuring exposure and outcome, the other with all outcomes occurring after exposure).

BASIC MODEL:
  •	Age
  •	Gender
  •	Racialised minority
  •	Highest education level 
  •	Pre-pandemic experience (for self-harm only) 
  •	Psychiatric disorder (*will do sensitivty analysis without EDs or disorders that include self-harm)
  • Key worker status 
  • Defined as vulnerable person according to Government 
  • Positive COVID test 
  • Change in economic activity
  • Change in living situation
  • Loneliness
  • Pandemic worry

## Increased loneliness at baseline
First, create numeric variable that demonstrates baseline PANDEMIC loneliness score
All questions begin with: Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt that the following statements apply to you?
```{r Baseline pandemic loneliness score}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("lone."),
                ~case_when(
                  . == "Hardly ever" ~ 0,
                  . == "Some of the time" ~ 1,
                  .  == "Often" ~ 2,
                  TRUE ~ NA_real_)))

```

Calculate PANDEMIC loneliness score
```{r Loneliness baseline score}
dat$loneliness_pandemic_count <- rowSums(dat[ ,
                                 c("lone.felt_alone",
                                   "lone.felt_isolated_from_others",
                                   "lone.felt_left_out",
                                   "lone.felt_that_you_lack_companionship")],
                                  na.rm = FALSE)

# Check
dat %>%
  freq(loneliness_pandemic_count)
```

Create numeric variable that demonstrates PREPANDEMIC loneliness score
Score of loneliness pre-pandemic
 All questions start with: Before the pandemic, how often have you felt that the following statements apply to you?
```{r Loneliness prepandemic score}
dat$loneliness_prepandemic_count <- rowSums(dat[ ,
                                 c("lone.felt_alone.1",
                                   "lone.felt_isolated_from_others.1",
                                   "lone.felt_left_out.1",
                                   "lone.felt_that_you_lack_companionship.1")],
                                  na.rm = FALSE)

# Check
dat %>%
  freq(loneliness_prepandemic_count)
```

Calculate whether they have experienced an increase in loneliness during the pandemic or not 
```{r Loneliness increased during pandemic}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(increased_loneliness_during_pandemic =
           case_when(
           loneliness_pandemic_count > loneliness_prepandemic_count ~ "Yes", # These people have higher loneliness scores at baseline than retrospective prepandemic loneliness scores
         loneliness_pandemic_count <= loneliness_prepandemic_count ~ "No", # These people have lower or the same loneliness scores at baseline than retrospective prepandemic loneliness scores
         )
  )

# Check
dat %>%
  freq(increased_loneliness_during_pandemic)
```

## Pandemic worry at baseline 
Participants are asked how worried they are about different factors, e.g., mental health, or employment. Before working out total score - First need to work out if participants answered any of these as 'not applicable' or if they did not answer (i.e., missing).

First need to create new variables in which '5' i.e., 'Not applicable' = 0, so that it is not included in final calculation of score. We can think of something not being applicable to someone in the same way as it not worrying them.
```{r Pandemic worry recode 'Not applicable' to 0}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("panworry.") &
                  contains("numeric"),
                ~case_when(
                  . == 5 ~ 0,
                  TRUE ~ .)))
```

Sum score of answers (e.g., score of 4 on a question = "Extremely worried")
```{r Pandemic worry sum score actual answers}
dat$panworry_total_score <- rowSums(dat[ ,
                                 c("panworry.impact_on_your_employment_status_numeric",

*The below use follow-up data and are coded so that exposures are only counted if they happened before or in same phase as the outcome*

## Positive covid test - three questionnaires (virus, resp, & dem)
NB: For the 'virus' questionnaire, there is no baseline assessment. However, there is a 'resp' questionnaire that is asked at baseline and at every follow up phase, so will include positive tests indicated in this questionnaire too, as well as people who indicated they were unwell with coronavirus in any of the demographic questionnaires.

Need to ensure COVID test occurred BEFORE outcomes - create new variable for COVID test that only counts positive tests as ones that occurred BEFORE each outcome. Will exclude anyone from the analysis if they experienced outcome before exposure, EVEN if it went: outcome → exposure → outcome. Should look at whether their FIRST experience of outcome came before (or at the same time of) their FIRST experience of exposure

Will also include co-occurring symptoms, but as a sensitivity analysis will get rid to further assess causal hypothesis.

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
+++ Why are first 4 waves empty?

## Losing someone due to COVID-19 (grief)
There are two questions in COPING that capture whether someone has lost someone due to COVID, in the 'grief' questionnaire in follow up B only and baseline ("In the past month, have you lost someone close to you due to COVID-19?") and the demographics questionnaire ("Has a relative that was previously ill with coronavirus or suspected coronavirus passed away?") in follow up A and B [not at baseline]

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
```{r First experience of exposure - losing someone}

## Change in living situation
### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure

Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
