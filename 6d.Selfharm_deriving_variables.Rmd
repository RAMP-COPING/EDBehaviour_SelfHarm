This script derives variables for the self-harm phenotype ready for regression analyses.
Configure global options for all chunks
```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = '',
  prompt = FALSE,
  cache = FALSE
  )
```

Clear global environment prior to initiation
```{r Clear global environment}
remove(list = ls())
```

Add the add_numeric function - used to convert character variables into numeric variables
Add the remove_duplicates function - used to deduplicate and remove NAs from IDs
Add the sumscores function - used to generate sumscores
Add the package_check function - used to install and load dependencies
Add the imp_check function - used to check variables for implausible values
```{r Read in functions}
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/add_numeric.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/remove_duplicates.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/package_check.R")
source("./functions.R")
```

Use package_check to install and load dependencies
Load tidyverse last
```{r Install load dependencies}
packages <- c("summarytools", "sjlabelled", "Amelia", "gtsummary", "tidyverse")
package_check(packages)
```

Retrieve recent date
We are using the recent date to save files with paste0() as an extension to not overwrite old versions
```{r Recent date}
date <- Sys.Date()
date
```

# Read in data
```{r Read in dataset}
dat <- readRDS("/Users/helenadavies/werk/EDBEHSELFHARM2/gitEDBEHSELFHARM/data_cleaned/final_dat_no_dup_entries2022-02-21.rds")
```

# Outcome = Self-harm

### PREPANDEMIC self-harm 
At baseline, participants are asked: "Before the pandemic, had you deliberately harmed yourself, whether or not you meant to end your life?" (taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline). Note again, there is no lifetime assessment of self-harm.
```{r Prepandemic self-harm experience}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(PREPANDEMIC_selfharm =
           case_when(
                    taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Not experienced self-harm before the pandemic
                    taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline == "Yes" ~ 1 # Experienced self-harm before the pandemic 
            )
  )

# Check 
dat %>%
  freq(PREPANDEMIC_selfharm) # NAs are either NA or PNTA for taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline 
```


### Self-harm during the pandemic 
Combined - self-harm: BASELINE experience OR FOLLOW UP experience (participants may have indicated experiencing it at baseline and/or at follow-up)

NB: This question "Before the pandemic, had you deliberately harmed yourself, whether or not you meant to end your life?" is shown to everyone, so I don't need to use the same logic as with the other baseline questions (i.e., there is no screener question that asks about lifetime self-harm). Because there is no lifetime assessment of self-harm, there might be some people who joined the study later (e.g., in November 2020) and had self-harmed earlier in the pandemic (e.g., July) but we would not capture them.

# Identify at which phase they first experienced the outcome
This is for ensuring the exposure is reported either BEFORE or in the SAME PHASE as the outcome. E.g,. we do not want to include cases of binge eating (for example) if they exposure (e.g., living situation change) was self-reported AFTER the binge eating.
First, need to identify at which phase participants first experienced each outcome, to ensure that their experience of the exposure happened BEFORE the outcome.

  • Pandemic worry
  • Defined as vulnerable person according to Government 
  • OCD screeners (for low weight model only)
  
[NB: for the below exposures, will need to derive these differently depending on the outcome because they were reported at every/every other phase and we are taking only those reported BEFORE or in the SAME PHASE as the outcome]
  • Positive COVID test or ill due to COVID  
  • Loss of loved one due to COVID
  • Change in economic activity
  • Change in living situation
 
 *The below use follow-up data and are coded so that exposures are only counted if they happened before or in same phase as the outcome*

## Positive covid test - three questionnaires (virus, resp, & dem)
NB: For the 'virus' questionnaire, there is no baseline assessment. However, there is a 'resp' questionnaire that is asked at baseline and at every follow up phase, so will include positive tests indicated in this questionnaire too, as well as people who indicated they were unwell with coronavirus in any of the demographic questionnaires.

Need to ensure COVID test occurred BEFORE outcomes - create new variable for COVID test that only counts positive tests as ones that occurred BEFORE each outcome. Will exclude anyone from the analysis if they experienced outcome before exposure, EVEN if it went: outcome → exposure → outcome. Should look at whether their FIRST experience of outcome came before (or at the same time of) their FIRST experience of exposure

Will also include co-occurring symptoms, but as a sensitivity analysis will get rid to further assess causal hypothesis.

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.

## Losing someone due to COVID-19 (grief)
There are two questions in COPING that capture whether someone has lost someone due to COVID, in the 'grief' questionnaire in follow up B only and baseline ("In the past month, have you lost someone close to you due to COVID-19?") and the demographics questionnaire ("Has a relative that was previously ill with coronavirus or suspected coronavirus passed away?") in follow up A and B [not at baseline]

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
```{r First experience of exposure - losing someone}

## Change in main eco activity (work/education)
### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure

Baseline:
employ.my_employment_status_has_not_changed = Has your employment status changed since the pandemic began? [My employment status has not changed]
employ.no_impact = How has this impacted your studies? [No impact]
employ.impact_on_studies_still_unknown = How has this impacted your studies? [Impact on studies still unknown]

Follow ups:
dem.household_employment_status_key: Has anything changed in the following domains in the last two weeks: Employment status of a key earner in your household
dem.employment: Has anything changed in the following domains in the last two weeks: Employment 
NB: No follow-up questions about studying.

Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure

Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
