This script derives variables ready for regression analyses.
Configure global options for all chunks
```{r Setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  comment = '',
  prompt = FALSE,
  cache = FALSE
  )
```

Clear global environment prior to initiation
```{r Clear global environment}
remove(list = ls())
```

Add the add_numeric function - used to convert character variables into numeric variables
Add the remove_duplicates function - used to deduplicate and remove NAs from IDs
Add the sumscores function - used to generate sumscores
Add the package_check function - used to install and load dependencies
Add the imp_check function - used to check variables for implausible values
```{r Read in functions}
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/add_numeric.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/remove_duplicates.R")
source(file = "/Users/helenadavies/werk/ilovedata/scripts/functions/package_check.R")
source("./functions.R")
```

Use package_check to install and load dependencies
Load tidyverse last
```{r Install load dependencies}
packages <- c("summarytools", "sjlabelled", "Amelia", "gtsummary", "tidyverse")
package_check(packages)
```

Retrieve recent date
We are using the recent date to save files with paste0() as an extension to not overwrite old versions
```{r Recent date}
date <- Sys.Date()
date
```

# Read in data
## data.final is generated from the "4.Merging" script
```{r Read in data}
dat <- readRDS(file = "../data_cleaned/all_dat2022-01-25.rds")

# Check
dim(dat)
colnames(dat)
```

# First, need to create single variables for those people who completed the same survey twice within a single phase
Any answers of "Yes" (i.e., endorsement of a behaviour) will mean that person is a "Yes" for that phase
Then, at least one "No" (and either missing or "No" for the other phase) will count as a "No"
Missing for both phases for the relevant variables = NA
## Demographics
```{r living situation creating single variables from duplicated IDs}

### Experience ever
In the follow ups and baseline, participants are also asked: "Many people have thoughts that life is not worth living. Have you felt that way". We need to capture both; people might endorse lifetime experience but not have felt that way in the past two weeks (either if they missed out on a follow up questionnaire so the gap between them was longer than two weeks, or because they've answered at a monthly follow-up [i.e., from August 2020 onwards])

### PREPANDEMIC passive suicidal ideation 
At baseline, participants are first asked: "Many people have thoughts that life is not worth living. Have you felt that way?" (taf.worth_living_thoughts_life_.Wavebaseline) Only those who say "Yes" are then asked "Had you felt that way before the pandemic?" (taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline). Therefore, we need to count those say "No" to the first question, AND those who say "Yes" to the first but "No" to the second as having no prepandemic experience.
```{r Passive suicidal ideation baseline pre-pandemic experience}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(PREPANDEMIC_passive_suicidal_ideation =
           case_when(
             
                  taf.worth_living_life_people_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Never experienced it (lifetime)
                  
                    taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Have in their life but not before the pandemic
                    taf.pandemic_felt_.Wavebaseline == "Yes" ~ 1 # Have in their life AND before the pandemic
                  )

### NEW passive suicidal ideation experience, i.e., those who at baseline indicated no prepandemic experience of passive suicidal ideation and then went on to experience it
Combined - passive suicidal ideation during the pandemic 
*Basically, if someone has said that they experienced it BEFORE the pandemic AND they endorse lifetime experience during the pandemic, it's hard for us to work out whether their experience is ONLY BEFORE the pandemic (therefore, should be 0 for pandemic experience) or whether they are referencing their experience BEFORE the pandemic AND during the pandemic (so should be 1 for pandemic experience). Decided to just look at those with NO prepandemic experience.

### Experience ever
In the follow ups, participants are also asked lifetime self-harm ideation: "Have you contemplated harming yourself?". We need to capture both; people might endorse lifetime experience but not have felt that way in the past two weeks (either if they missed out on a follow up questionnaire so the gap between them was longer than two weeks, or because they've answered at a monthly follow-up [i.e., from August 2020 onwards])

### PREPANDEMIC self-harm ideation 
At baseline, participants are first asked: "Have you contemplated harming yourself ?" (taf.have_you_contemplated_harming_yourself_.Wavebaseline) Only those who say "Yes" are then asked "Had you felt that way before the pandemic?" (taf.pandemic_felt.1_.Wavebaseline). Therefore, we need to count those say "No" to the first question, AND those who say "Yes" to the first but "No" to the second as having no prepandemic experience.

### PREPANDEMIC self-harm 
At baseline, participants are asked: "Before the pandemic, had you deliberately harmed yourself, whether or not you meant to end your life?" (taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline). Note again, there is no lifetime assessment of self-harm.
```{r Prepandemic self-harm experience}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(PREPANDEMIC_selfharm =
           case_when(
                    taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline == "No" ~ 0, # Not experienced self-harm before the pandemic
                    taf.meant_end_life_pandemic_.Wavebaseline == "Yes" ~ 1 # Experienced self-harm before the pandemic 
            )
  )

# Check

```


### Self-harm during the pandemic 
Combined - self-harm: BASELINE experience OR FOLLOW UP experience (participants may have indicated experiencing it at baseline and/or at follow-up)

NB: This question "Before the pandemic, had you deliberately harmed yourself, whether or not you meant to end your life?" is shown to everyone, so I don't need to use the same logic as with the other baseline questions (i.e., there is no screener question that asks about lifetime self-harm). Because there is no lifetime assessment of self-harm, there might be some people who joined the study later (e.g., in November 2020) and had self-harmed earlier in the pandemic (e.g., July) but we would not capture them.

# Identify at which phase they first experienced the outcome
This is for ensuring the exposure is reported either BEFORE or in the SAME PHASE as the outcome. E.g,. we do not want to include cases of binge eating (for example) if they exposure (e.g., living situation change) was self-reported AFTER the binge eating.
First, need to identify at which phase participants first experienced each outcome, to ensure that their experience of the exposure happened BEFORE the outcome.

## Increased loneliness at baseline
First, create numeric variable that demonstrates baseline PANDEMIC loneliness score
All questions begin with: Over the past two weeks, how often have you felt that the following statements apply to you?
```{r Baseline pandemic loneliness score}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("lone."),
                ~case_when(
                  . == "Hardly ever" ~ 0,
                  . == "Some of the time" ~ 1,
                  .  == "Often" ~ 2,
                  TRUE ~ NA_real_)))

```

Calculate PANDEMIC loneliness score

Create numeric variable that demonstrates PREPANDEMIC loneliness score
Score of loneliness pre-pandemic
 All questions start with: Before the pandemic, how often have you felt that the following statements apply to you?
```{r Loneliness prepandemic score}

## Pandemic worry at baseline 
Participants are asked how worried they are about different factors, e.g., mental health, or employment. Before working out total score - First need to work out if participants answered any of these as 'not applicable' or if they did not answer (i.e., missing).

First need to create new variables in which '5' i.e., 'Not applicable' = 0, so that it is not included in final calculation of score. We can think of something not being applicable to someone in the same way as it not worrying them.
```{r Pandemic worry recode 'Not applicable' to 0}
dat <- dat %>%
  mutate(across(starts_with("panworry.") &
                  contains("numeric"),
                ~case_when(
                  . == 5 ~ 0,
                  TRUE ~ .)))
```

Sum score of answers (e.g., score of 4 on a question = "Extremely worried")
```{r Pandemic worry sum score actual answers}
dat$panworry_total_score <- rowSums(dat[ ,
                                 c("panworry.impact_on_your_employment_status_numeric",

*The below use follow-up data and are coded so that exposures are only counted if they happened before or in same phase as the outcome*

## Positive covid test - three questionnaires (virus, resp, & dem)
NB: For the 'virus' questionnaire, there is no baseline assessment. However, there is a 'resp' questionnaire that is asked at baseline and at every follow up phase, so will include positive tests indicated in this questionnaire too, as well as people who indicated they were unwell with coronavirus in any of the demographic questionnaires.

Need to ensure COVID test occurred BEFORE outcomes - create new variable for COVID test that only counts positive tests as ones that occurred BEFORE each outcome. Will exclude anyone from the analysis if they experienced outcome before exposure, EVEN if it went: outcome → exposure → outcome. Should look at whether their FIRST experience of outcome came before (or at the same time of) their FIRST experience of exposure

Will also include co-occurring symptoms, but as a sensitivity analysis will get rid to further assess causal hypothesis.

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
```{r First experience of exposure - positive COVID test - virus, dem and resp Q}

## Losing someone due to COVID-19 (grief)
There are two questions in COPING that capture whether someone has lost someone due to COVID, in the 'grief' questionnaire in follow up B only and baseline ("In the past month, have you lost someone close to you due to COVID-19?") and the demographics questionnaire ("Has a relative that was previously ill with coronavirus or suspected coronavirus passed away?") in follow up A and B [not at baseline]

### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure
Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
```{r First experience of exposure - losing someone}

## Change in main eco activity (work/education)
### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure

Baseline:
employ.my_employment_status_has_not_changed = Has your employment status changed since the pandemic began? [My employment status has not changed]
employ.no_impact = How has this impacted your studies? [No impact]
employ.impact_on_studies_still_unknown = How has this impacted your studies? [Impact on studies still unknown]

Follow ups:
dem.household_employment_status_key: Has anything changed in the following domains in the last two weeks: Employment status of a key earner in your household
dem.employment: Has anything changed in the following domains in the last two weeks: Employment 
NB: No follow-up questions about studying.

Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.

## Change in living situation
### Identify at which phase they first experienced the exposure

Exposure must come before the outcome. Need to identify at which wave participants first experienced each exposure (as well as first experience of each outcome), to ensure that their first experience of the exposure happened BEFORE their first experience of the outcome.
